# 🧠 Blender Beginner Workshop -  Overview

## ⭐ Goal
Introduce complete beginners to Blender with a hands-on overview covering installation, interface, modeling, sculpting, materials, and rendering.

---

## ✅ Topics Covered (With Notes)

### 1. ⚖️ Installation
**What to Do:**
- Visit [https://blender.org](https://blender.org)
- Download the latest Blender version (Windows/macOS/Linux supported)
- Install and open it

**Why It Matters:**
- Getting started with Blender is just a download away

---

### 2. 🖼️ Interface & Navigation
**Key Areas:**
- **3D Viewport** - Where you model and animate
- **Outliner** - Lists all objects in your scene
- **Properties Panel** - Control settings like materials and render options
- **Timeline** - For animation (optional for this session)

**Navigation Basics:**
- Rotate View: Middle Mouse Button (MMB)
- Pan: Shift + MMB
- Zoom: Scroll Wheel
- Focus on Object: `Numpad .`

**Quick Keys:**
- `G` = Grab (move)
- `S` = Scale
- `R` = Rotate
- `Tab` = Toggle Edit/Object mode

**Tip:** Blender is context-sensitive. Make sure you’re in the right mode (Object vs Edit).

**Example Activity:** Try selecting the default cube, moving it around, scaling it, and rotating it.

---

### 3. 🔹 Basic Modeling
**Start With:**
- `Shift + A` → Mesh → Cube/UV Sphere
- `Tab` → Edit Mode
- Use vertex (1), edge (2), face (3) selection modes

**Modeling Tools:**
- `E` - Extrude (pull new geometry out)
- `Ctrl + R` - Loop Cut (add edge loops)
- `X` - Delete

**Activity:** Make a simple table, dice, or letter block

**Goal:** Understand how 3D objects are built from vertices, edges, and faces

---

### 4. 💪 Sculpting
**Switch to Sculpting Workspace**
- Use brushes like Draw, Grab, Smooth
- Hold `Shift` for smoothing
- Enable Dyntopo (Dynamic Topology) for more detail

**Best Used For:**
- Organic shapes (characters, creatures)

**Tip:** Start with a UV Sphere for sculpting

**Example Activity:** Sculpt a cartoonish face or blob monster

---

### 5. 🎨 Materials & Lighting
**Go to Shading Tab:**
- Select an object → Click New Material
- Change Base Color, Roughness, etc.

**Add a Light:**
- `Shift + A` → Light → Point/Sun
- Move it around to see how light affects the material

**Preview Shaders:** Use Material Preview mode (Z → Material Preview)

**Why It Matters:** Adds realism to your scene

**Example Activity:** Color your object and test how light direction changes its look

---

### 6. 📷 Rendering
**Set the Camera:**
- `Numpad 0` to look through camera
- Move camera with `G`/`R`, or lock to view in the N panel (View tab)

**Render Engine:**
- **Eevee** = Real-time
- **Cycles** = Photorealistic (slower)

**Render:**
- `F12` to render
- Save: Image → Save As

**Goal:** Take a snapshot of your 3D scene

**Example Activity:** Render your table or dice model with lighting and color

---

### 7. 📝 Optional: Grease Pencil / Animation

**Grease Pencil:**
- Start new file: 2D Animation
- Use the draw tool like traditional animation
- Use timeline for frame-by-frame animation

**Simple Animation:**
- Select object
- On Frame 1: `I` → Location
- On Frame 30: Move → `I` → Location again
- Press Spacebar to play

**Example Activity:** Animate a cube bouncing up and down

---

### 8. 🤔 Recap & Q&A
**Quick Review:**
- Interface layout
- Navigation shortcuts
- Object creation and editing
- Intro to sculpting, shading, and rendering

**Open Floor:**
- Ask your questions
- Try things hands-on with help

---
